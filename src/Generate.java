 * A program to syntactically analyse programs written in SCC# using recursive
 * descent. I have added four new non-terminals `<assignment statement 
 * remainder>`, `<if statement remainder>`, `<expression remainder>` and
 * `<condition remainder>`, which were the results of applying left-recursion
 * to a number of original productions. I have also removed the `<term>`
 * non-terminal and rolled it into the `<factor>` non-terminal for simplicity,
 * as `<term>` was redundant.
 *
